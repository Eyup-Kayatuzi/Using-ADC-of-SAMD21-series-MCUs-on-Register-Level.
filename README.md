# Using-ADC-of-SAMD21-series-MCUs-on-Register-Level.
We can easily change Vref value of ADC by register Level. It is difficult to do it with Atmel Start
This project is written with C Language on Atmel Studio(Microchip Studio). 
You can easily config on all samd21 series by changing model of mcu by Device > Change Device on Atmel Studio. 
Also you can change clock frequency to what you desired on using clock.c file.
PLEASE WORK ONLY REGISTER LEVEL AS EMBEDDED SOFTWARE ENGINEER. THAT'S THE POINT. :)
